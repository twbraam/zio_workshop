# ZIO Applications

In ZIO Applications, you will solidify your extensive knowledge of ZIO to build realistic applications across a variety of domains. 
As you build interactive applications, you'll gain insight into how to structure purely functional code bases, 
how to refactor them, and how to design them to take advantage of the features provided by ZIO. By the end of the day, 
you will feel confident using ZIO to meet complex real-world challenges, without assistance from anyone, 
and you'll be able to mentor new team members on real-world, pure functional programming.
